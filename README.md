# Machine Learning

In this repository I have inserted notebook files of machine learning algorithms. These files include a notebook that explains the algorithm and a Python file that I wrote the algorithm.

- Each of the machine learning algorithms is located in separate folders.
- I have just collected this information and organized it.
- The resources I have used to prepare these booklets are written at the end of each notebook file.

# What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
